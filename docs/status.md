# Current project status

## Objective

Turn the running local portal foundation into the first complete request → deliberate authorization → real agent-built preview → owner review loop, while moving mutable product records out of hand-edited Markdown.

## Next action

**B-03B — validate the supervised cycle, then integrate execution.** PW-01A now supplies the accepted Work shell and safe changed-input refresh. B-03B remains the next dependency for live worker transport, leases, recovery and immutable candidate review. It requires separate authorization before execution. [PW-01A evidence](evidence/pw-01a-work-implementation.md) · [execution packet](execution-plan.md#b-03b--validate-the-supervised-cycle-then-integrate-execution).

## Ready queue

1. **B-03B** — prerequisites and accepted Work shell exist; prepare the bounded implementation scope before authorization.

One packet at a time. B-03's worker/artifact/recovery work remains required; [proposed dependency order](design/project-workspace/v1/delivery-plan.md).

## Active blockers

- **Operational records:** PW-01A is complete and exposes unavailable states rather than synthetic telemetry. Connected milestone records and live agent/server/spend telemetry still depend on later domain and B-03 work. [Implementation evidence](evidence/pw-01a-work-implementation.md) · [passed design QA](../apps/portal/design-qa.md).
- **Owner interface validation:** portal-only dispatch is suspended by DEC-029 after ready work became unstartable under stale/open decision checks. The replacement must prove recovery from changed decision inputs before portal-first dispatch returns. Prior request/proposal/authorization evidence remains historical.
- **Automated execution/review:** full B-03 remains incomplete. B-03B must supply worker transport/leases/recovery and immutable candidate review, including DEC-026 review-bar migration.
- **Candidate acceptance/external effects:** Q-005 and Q-008 remain gates; DEC-028 resolves Q-002 only for supervised local scope.
- **External preview/provider use:** local waiver does not authorize external deployment or spending. The vendor GitHub App flow is locally/mocked verified, but no app registration, live authorization/installation, repository creation or GitHub push has occurred.
- **M3 generality:** Q-003 needs a representative second-product brief.

## Current facts and evidence

- DEC-031 names the self-hosting product Aludel. Project-owned brand metadata and bounded raster uploads now drive the shell; the supplied alchemical workshop art is the current hero. Node 24 typecheck/build, five server/domain suites, and a disposable wide/narrow accessibility browser flow pass. [Evidence/post-hoc](design/process/aludel-brand-work-record.md).
- D-02 audits 11 request concerns, proposes product-area vs change-centric organization, six owner journeys and phased records/preview/project-setup contracts. [Evidence/post-hoc](design/project-workspace/v1/work-record.md); no strategy features or historical migration implemented.
- D-04 retains four owner-job surfaces. [V7 reference study](design/project-workspace/v7/work-record.md) records screenshot-backed directions. [V9 composition evidence](design/project-workspace/v9/work-record.md) applies them and passes static desktop/narrow browser checks; no new product interaction or runtime capability is claimed.
- DEC-029 supersedes DEC-028 for interim dispatch: explicit chat instructions authorize recorded bounded local work. B-03A's portal bridge remains evidence for the replacement, but its current state cannot block work. The portal runs at `http://127.0.0.1:4310`; no automatic worker is connected. [Evidence and retrospective](evidence/b-03a-supervised-cycle.md).

- DEC-027 records the explicit local-only G-00 waiver and owner-confirmed M1 transition. No external effect or spend is implied.
- B-02 is complete for its local boundary. Saved requests create versioned proposals; decisions use immutable revisions and optimistic conflict checks; exact dependency bindings stale only linked records; reassessment is explicit and starts no execution.
- [B-02 evidence](evidence/b-02-product-records.md) records domain and browser proof that `PLAN-B02` became stale while unrelated `PLAN-B03` remained current, retained-draft conflict recovery, proposal revisioning, restart persistence, Storybook states, accessibility and narrow layout.
- B-01 is complete for its local boundary. `./launch-machine` builds and serves the portal at `http://127.0.0.1:4310`; first-run owner setup happens in the browser without logging the key.
- [B-01 evidence](evidence/b-01-local-foundation.md) records unauthenticated rejection; owner setup/login and restart persistence; 67-document real-corpus import; 435 source relationships; idempotent re-import; changed-source revision testing; durable requests; search/detail UI; Storybook; build/typecheck; axe; and 390px browser checks.
- Angular 22 / Material 22 and explicit Storybook stories are now adopted for the portal implementation. SQLite is the tested zero-service local adapter; PostgreSQL remains the hosted-direction candidate. The database is authoritative for new mutable owner requests; Markdown remains seed/audit evidence and repository authority for code-adjacent contracts.
- The Overview now exposes a vendor-owned GitHub App flow: deployment-managed app identity, owner OAuth/installation, eligible account selection, explicit repository confirmation, recoverable create/initialize/push, and a fresh repository-scoped installation token for every Git operation. Organization/personal endpoint-token behavior, state/PKCE, JWT signing, redaction, recovery, disposable bare-remote push, build/typecheck and responsive/axe browser checks pass locally. The workspace intentionally remains without usable Git history until the owner completes the live portal action. [Implementation evidence and retrospective](design/process/enterprise-github-app-work-record.md).
- R-03, R-06B, and R-05 provide the bounded local Codex path, Symphony/Linear direction, and recovery protocol evidence for later B-03 integration.

## Latest handoff

2026-09-21: DEC-031 names the product Aludel and moves name, tagline, description, accent and hero art behind a reusable project brand contract with bounded upload. Local domain/build and responsive accessibility checks pass. [Evidence](design/process/aludel-brand-work-record.md). B-03B remains the single next planning pointer.
